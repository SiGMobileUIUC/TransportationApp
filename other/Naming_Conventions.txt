Please make sure your variable naming follows the convention below.
If there is anything missing, inform me.

Inside *.java:
  Use private/public identifiers.
  Everything variable should be camelCased with the exception of constants.
  If the variable is reference to some views/layouts, use the camelCased
  version of its id, ignore the activity/fragment specifier and replace the abbreviation of the type with the full name. If anything induces unclearness, clearly state it with comments, and use the naming that you fell clear.
  constants should be private/public static final, and the naming uppercased,
  space separated with underlines.
  e.g.:
  private int userChoice;
  private TextView textViewLogin; <--id: activity_main_tv_login;
  private static final int SPEAKER_INTENT_RETURN_CODE = 101;

Inside layouts:
  For layout itself, name it with activity/fragment/content/app_bar/_<NAME>.xml
  For the ids, name them with activity/fragment_<NAME>_<TYPE>_[DESCRIPTION].
  Use abbreviation for types.
  e.g.:
  activity_main.xml
  activity_main_tv_login
  fragment_card_display_btn_return
  A short list of abbreviations:
    btn---Button
    tv----TextView
    et----EditText
    rv----RecyclerView
    ll----LinearLayout
    rl----RelativeLayout
    fl----FrameLayout
    dl----DrawerLayout
    cv----CardView
    nb----NavigationBar
    fab---FloatingActionButton
    map---GoogleMap[Fragment]
  If there is anything else needed, inform me.

For colors:
  Name it with color_<DESCRIPTION>_<COLOR>
  e.g.:
  color_main_activity_button_logout_blue
  color_application_default_text_transparent_red

For strings:
  Name it with string_<TYPE>_<USAGE/DESCRIPTION>
  e.g.:
  string_notification_not_logged_in
  string_error_no_network

For drawables:
  Name images with <IMAGE_SUFFIX>_<DESCRIPTION>
  Name custom drawables with drawable_<DESCRIPTION>
  e.g.:
  png_bus_small
  drawable_main_activity_button_logout_background
